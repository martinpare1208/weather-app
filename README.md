# Hello!
My name is Martin Pare and I am a current Information Systems Major at University of Maryland. I have a passion for computer programming and I have high aspirations to become a software engineer.

I am currently self-teaching myself through Udemy courses. I am using these courses to teach myself core computer science concepts like OOP and DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms).

## Weather App, My Key Takeaways and What I have Learned.
A totally-not-so overdone project! This project is meant to apply what I have learned through my self-teaching journey. I used HTML to build the skeleton and CSS to make the website look presentable and used Flexbox
to handle relative positioning of items. Then JavaScript is utilized and I used an OpenWeather API to fetch json data. I then parsed the JSON data by going through it line by line with console.log() function.
What this project taught me is how APIs work and how to manipulate the data you receive from them. Then with the API data you receive, you use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document-Object Model).
Not only that, it also taught me how to read documentation. Knowing where to look and understand documentation is a key valuable skill when learning a new technology.
This was a very fun project and I feel proud to be able to use my skills that I learned into a working application.

## Thanks For Reading! Have a nice day!
